## Before you start

### Backend API

Make sure you set the URL to the backend. You can run it locally (see TODO) or you can point to the demo instance. 

To connect to the demo instance, add `export API_URL="http://demo.api.almighty.io/api/"` to your `.bash_profile` and reload the shell.

## VS Code

* Run `ext install EditorConfig` to read the .editorconfig file
