**Fabric8 Planner is a task planner and issue tracker front-end.**

It uses https://github.com/almighty/almighty-core[Fabric8 Work Item Tracker]
as the back-end.

== Running the app

=== Set NODE_ENV
If you're just trying to test the application, please use inmemory mode which
will load the app with mock data for you. If you, however, want to contribute
to the codebase, unset it back or to "development" (default) mode and rebuild.


[source,shell]
```
$ export NODE_ENV=inmemory # <1>
$ export NODE_ENV=development # <2>
$ export NODE_ENV=production # <3>

<1> In-memory mode for trying-out the app
<2> Development mode for contributing to the source
<2> Production mode for deploying the application
```

Once you're done setting the environment, you can proceed with the next step(s)

NOTE: If you're directly trying to run the app in dev mode, you can skip this
step, as *`NODE_ENV`* is treated as `"development"` by default.

IMPORTANT: If you're trying out the app `"inmemory"` mode, then after running
the app (as explained in the next step) please don't forget to
http://localhost:8088/?token_json=%7B%22access_token%22%3A%22somerandomtoken%22%2C%22expires_in%22%3A1800%2C%22refresh_expires_in%22%3A1800%2C%22refresh_token%22%3A%22somerandomtoken%22%2C%22token_type%22%3A%22bearer%22%7D[visit this URL]
to load it up with mock data, including the authenticated/logged-in user.

=== First run

If you're trying to run the app for the first time:

 $ npm install

Then, start the app with:

 $ npm start

=== Fresh run

If you trying to refresh your installation, you need to run:

 $ npm run reinstall

Then, start the app with:

 $ npm start

=== Testcase run

To run the linter, build validator, unit tests, and functional test use:

 $ npm test

== Other useful scripts

The *`package.json`* file's `scripts:` section lists _all the tasks_ we run.

Here are some of the most useful/frequently used scripts you may need to run:

[cols="1,2,4", options="header"]
|===
|Scipt
|Command
|Description

|Lint
|`$ npm run lint`
|Runs the TypeScript and Angular 2 linter

|Validation
|`$ npm run validate`
|Validates the webpack build

|Unit Tests
|`$ npm run test:unit`
|Runs the unit tests

|Functional Tests
|`$ npm run test:func`
|Runs the functional tests

|Continuous Tests
|`$ npm run watch:test`
|Looks for changes in source code and runs unit tests
|===

=== CI scripts

There are some other scripts for CI-environment; such as `run_unit_tests.sh`,
`run_functional_tests.sh`, `cico_run_tests.sh`, `cico_build_deploy.sh` etc.
They're generally not meant to be run manually.

== Building the app

=== Production build

To generate production build, set API URL and run build script as follows:

----
$ npm run build:prod
----

The build output will be under `dist` directory.

*To create a docker image,* run this command immediately after the production
build completion:

----
$ docker build -t fabric8-planner-deploy -f Dockerfile.deploy .
----

=== Library Build

==== For production:

To build the Planner as an npm library, use:

----
$ npm run build
----

The created library will be placed in `dist`.

IMPORTANT: *You shouldn't ever publish the build manually,* instead you should
let the CD pipeline do a semantic release.

==== For development:

To build fabric8-planner as an npm library and embed it into a webapp such as
fabric8-ui, you should:

Step 1: Run `npm run watch:library` in the source directory::
This will build fabric8-planner as a library and then set up a watch task to
rebuild any ts, html and scss files you change.

Step 2: Run `npm link <path to fabric8-planner>/dist-watch`::
In the webapp into which you are embedding. This will create a symlink from
`node_modules/fabric8-planner` to the `dist-watch` directory and install that
symlinked node module into your webapp.

Step 3: Run your webapp in development mode::
Make sure you have a watch on `node_modules/fabric8-planner` enabled. You will
have access to both JS and SASS sourcemaps if your webapp is properly setup.

NOTE: `fabric8-ui` is setup to do reloading and sourcemaps automatically when you
run `npm start`.

== Running with the launcher script

The above integration can be run with the provided launcher script in scripts/. See
the script for details on how to run it.

== CSS and SASS

fabric8-planner uses SASS for it's stylesheets. It also uses the Angular emulation
of the shadow dom, so you will normally want to place your styles in the
`.component.scss` file next to the html and the typescript.

If you find yourself wanting to create a shared style that multiple components will
use, then we recommend adding it as a mixin to
`src/assets/stylesheets/_planner-mixins.scss`. The mixins are imported in to every
`.component.scss` file. You can then create a real class by doing something like

    .my-class {
      @include my-class;
    }

We use mixins to avoid polluting components with uncessary style classes, and to avoid
an explosion of shared files.

The `src/assets/stylesheets/` directory includes a `shared` directory. These are
shared global styles that we will refactor out in to a shared library at some point.
Only update these styles if you are making a truly global style, and are going to
synchronise your changes across all the various UI projects.
